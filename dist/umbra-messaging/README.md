# Umbra Messaging
Very basic system using CDK to make a toasts. 

The goals:
1) Stackable toasts that can be in any position. (Can be turned off)
2) Toasts that can be closed or fade out or time. (Can do both at some time)
3) Ability to send in your own templates for the toasts.
4) Ability to change the position strategy and attach to other elements.
5) Ability to change icons as wanted.
6) Ability to have multiple messages in a toast, each with the ability to fade or be closed.
